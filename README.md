# AI-Assisted Medical Image Reconstruction and Denoising

This ongoing project focuses on applying deep learning techniques to medical imaging, aiming to enhance and reconstruct low-dose modalities such as PET and MRI scans. The current implementation is based on a U-Net architecture, with plans to extend the framework to include diffusion models and physics-informed networks.

A demo of the model pipeline and results is available in the `/notebooks` folder.

## ‚ú® Features

- Denoising of simulated low-dose PET/MRI images
- U-Net-based model with optional skip connections or attention modules
- Evaluation using PSNR, SSIM, and visual metrics (not showing in demo)
- Easily extendable for reconstruction or segmentation tasks
