# AI-Assisted Medical Image Reconstruction and Denoising

This project focuses on using deep learning techniques to enhance and reconstruct low-dose medical images such as PET and MRI scans. The model architecture is based on U-Net, with potential for future extensions to diffusion models or physics-informed networks.

## ‚ú® Features

- Denoising of simulated low-dose PET/MRI images
- U-Net-based model with optional skip connections or attention modules
- Evaluation using PSNR, SSIM, and visual metrics
- Easily extendable for reconstruction or segmentation tasks
